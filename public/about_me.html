<p>I began classes at Azerbaijan Technical University in 2017.
   I graduated from Azerbaijan Technical University in 2021
   But I can tell that briefly about it this was a bad experience
   in my life.</p>

<p>I am working for a company called Aztelekom.
   I am an IT technician person(helpdesk) here.
   But I want to be a web developer. This is my dream.
   I am looking for a remote job. This is what I want to be. 
   This is my best dream. I am open to developing myself.
   I want this a lot and I will get it at the end. 
   Because I believe in and trust myself. I'll be the best in this sector.</p>
